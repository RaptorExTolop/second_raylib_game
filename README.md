# second_raylib_game

Hello everyone! Welcome to the code for my first ever game written in golang! 
Currently this game is in Dev builds  - what I call my builds made for devs (which is me XD)
Currently the build for this game only has basic funcitonality, which at the time of last updating is:
Idle & running player animations
Basic stationry background
Inout for moving left, right, & jumping
Code for moving left & right
Animations for idle[left & right] and running[left & right]

This will get updated every so often as I learn more about go, raylib and what I want the game to be.
Enjoy the source code!
